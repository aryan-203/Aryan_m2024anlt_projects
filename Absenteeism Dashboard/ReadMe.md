## Introduction
This Power BI dashboard delivers a comprehensive overview of employee absenteeism within a retail organization, leveraging detailed attendance and HR data to visualize trends, risks, and workforce costs[file:2]. The goal is to empower HR and operations teams with actionable, real-time insights.

## Data Origin
The underlying dataset includes records for 3499 employees, tracking demographics, job information, department, division, shift, joining date, absence details (date, type, reason, status), cost metrics (transportation expense, absenteeism cost), and disciplinary actions. Data covers periods in 2023 and 2024[file:2].

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop (visual analytics and dashboards)
- Excel or SQL (for any supplementary data wrangling)

## Dashboard Features

- **Leave Type Distribution:** Pie chart displays paid, unpaid, and medical leaves for quick breakdown.
- **Department & Division Analysis:** Bar charts show attendance and absenteeism by department and division, spotlighting problematic areas.
- **Shift Pattern Analysis:** Stacked bar chart visualizes morning, evening, and night shift absenteeism.
- **Temporal Trends:** Monthly and seasonal absence tracked with line/bar charts, identifying peak seasons (e.g., winter/spring).
