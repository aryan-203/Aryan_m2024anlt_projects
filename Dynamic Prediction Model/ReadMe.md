# Dynamic Prediction Model 🔮📈  

## 🧠 Introduction  
This project focuses on building a **Dynamic Prediction Model** that continuously adapts to changing data patterns to improve forecasting accuracy over time.  
The goal is to design an intelligent and flexible system capable of making real-time predictions using historical and streaming data inputs, applicable across domains like finance, operations, and customer behavior analytics.

## 📊 Data Origin  
The dataset contains **time-dependent or sequential data**, representing evolving patterns over specific intervals.  
Each observation is associated with multiple numerical and categorical features that influence the target variable dynamically.  

This structure allows the model to learn from both **past trends** and **current fluctuations**, ensuring predictive adaptability to new data points.  

**Key attributes include:**
- **Time:** Represents the temporal order of data entries.  
- **Feature Variables:** Numerical and categorical variables contributing to prediction accuracy.  
- **Target Variable:** Represents the outcome to be predicted dynamically (e.g., demand level, risk score, or price change).
